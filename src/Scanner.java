//Program a scanner in Java based on your finite state machine in step B. Your scanner should:
//Define a state-transition table in the form of a two-dimensional array.
//Input a string or character sequence from a user, file, or standard channel.

// Output a stream of tokens to a user, file, or standard channel. Your stream of tokens should:
	// Represent each token’s class, like the abstract concept of a keyword, operator, identifier, or literal.
	// Represent each token’s value, if any, like the concrete name of an identifier or numeric value of a literal.
